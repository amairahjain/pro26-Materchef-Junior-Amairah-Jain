EGGLESS CLASSIC SUGAR GLAZED DOUGHNUT(DONUT) :

Donut is considered to have originated from New York, people eat in Breakfast, as a snack or dessert. Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, either in a ring shape or in several shapes without a hole. After frying the dough it is sprinkled with sugar, or icing is done or we can eat it plain as well. I have written its ingredients as well as its recipe !
