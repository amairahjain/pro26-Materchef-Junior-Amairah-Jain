RECIPE(STEPS):

Take flour, salt, baking powder, yeast, sugar in a mixing bowl. Mix well.

Make a dent, add melt butter, warm milk.

Mix and make a sticky dough. The dough should be on sticky side but not watery. So adjust milk or flour as needed.

Knead for 5 minutes and keep aside in a warm place, covering the bowl with lid. Once the dough is double after rising ;knead again smoothly. 

In a clean counter top, sprinkle flour and spread out the dough to thick sheet. Using a cookie cutter, cut a big circle and then using a small cutter/lid cut a small circle inside the big one. Repeat to make other doughnuts.

Heat enough oil (regulate to medium or low heat while frying.)in a flat bottomed pan and once the oil is hot, place the doughnuts carefully into the oil.

Cook both sides until golden in colour. Drain over paper towel and sprinkle the doughnuts with sugar.
